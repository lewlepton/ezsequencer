Learning Licence [LL]

I want you to learn from this, to edit & build upon it. To make it better &/or more interesting. To create cool things.

You can not sell this software for profit.
It's for learning & using in your own works, which you can freely profit from since it's not selling the software, but instead, selling your works that you have made with the software.
Selling the software outright is a 'no no', plain & simple.

You can however, use it for anything that is deemed useful or interesting to make things awesome & the such. Basically, be creative & have fun.

I want you to learn & be able to build upon things that have been made before. Expand your mind, make cool things, but not to directly profit from things that they themselves are not looking for profit.

So please be fair. But please do enjoy yourself & have a great time.
