# EZSequencer

hectic piece of software that links Max 8, to Logic Pro X, to EZDrummer2.<br>
you can also use the [annoyingly hardly updated] Mira application on iPad to input sequences, though happily its not needed to enjoy, hooray ðŸ¤˜

it was created simply so i could use a better sequencer for inputing drum sequences that can talk to EZDrummer2, especially so i could use an iPad. so i dont have to click things in using a mouse

it accesses the entire sample set of an EZDrummer2 kit. they are hard wired in as well, so some kits [though not many] may not have the full hits in

best of all, this also has control for velocity for each hit, which is how you put in a drum hit in the first place. so you can have silly amounts of fun playing with different ways to make awesome drum loops ðŸ¤™

it even has polyrythmic capabilites as well. so any drum channel can have its own amount of steps, so you can have *really* interesting things going on

it links to Logic via rewire, & is also sync to the tempo. so if you change the tempo in Logic, it will change in EZSequencer

you can view a full demo of it in action [using Mira] [HERE](https://pixelfed.social/p/lewlepton/263143750186962944) - it was super fun, i cant lie. the videos desciption also goes into great detail about things as well. but i will still say about the *problems* below

but all in all it works. it is fun & hope you have fun with it too

the main problem i can say, without a shadow of a doubt, is Mira support, which is what i really wanted.<br>
i dont want to always click things in, plus didnt want to go the OSC route, *yet*. because that would entail much more work, & i wanted a direct input, get it made so i can move on, & Mira does fit that bill, for *some* of the part<br>
it can be slow at times. Mira **still** doesnt have support for many useful objects that would make creating patches better [& faster] for interaction. so the patching itself is kind of a mess because of that. **bpatcher** is still [for over 8 years] not supported. so this is why things are kind of all over the place in terms of the patching

i would like to look at this again some time & maybe get OSC support in, or if the bpatcher fiasco ever gets put in [*which im not holding my breath for*], then i will fix the patching issue[s]

but those days are not coming anytime soon, so if you wanna do something with it, have fun ðŸ¤˜
